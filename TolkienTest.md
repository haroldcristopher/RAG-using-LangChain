## Tolkien Test

Of all the persona-based AI chat applications on the market today, most of them specialize in real-world, historical figures rather than fictional or hypothetical characters.

It's known, but not widely, that J.R.R. Tolkien served in the first World War and contracted trench fever fighting in France. Tolkien's [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien) mentions his experience in the trenches six times, and the late author recalled it as the most serious illness he ever faced.

By asking the question

> _What happened to you in France?_

Without requiring specific training, we should expect a realistic J.R.R. Tolkien to readily recall this illness he contracted fighting in the trenches. Here are some examples starting with Arthas.AI:

#### Arthas.AI

_This Tolkien immediately reports in classic Tolkien style fighting in the trenches, falling ill, and returning to England._

#### character.ai

_This Tolkien begins with clarifying questions, but is unable to immediately recall the illness without some back-and-forth, though he does recall fighting in the trenches._

Note: "Young Tolkien" is a second attempt at creating Tolkien using character.ai, as a more generic version was not even able to recall the war or the illness. Because character.ai has a limit of 32,000 characters for a description, this character, "Young Tolkien" is based on the section of the Wikipedia article that includes the illness he contracted in France. But even when given this specific body of knowledge, character.ai is not able to give a realistic response.

#### Knowtify

_This Tolkien only took one clarifying question to mention the illness, and was able to readily recall it in a classic Tolkien style._

#### AI History Chat

_This Tolkien doesn't even know he's been to France, let alone fought in a war or contracted a serious illness._

#### ChatGPT

_With some initial prompting to take on the style of Tolkien, vanilla ChatGPT - which has access to Wikipedia articles - does a decent job of recalling the events. The challenge with ChatGPT is limiting the scope of what Tolkien should and should not know. I would almost call this "Wise Tolkien" as he has additional knowledge access._

#### Hello History, Text History, and other "historical figures" apps on iOS/Android

_N/A_

Note: J.R.R. Tolkien doesn't exist in most of the apps that have a predefined list of AI personas, but I'm excited to try again if they ever add Tolkien, or the ability to add a custom persona.
