What I learned from Arthas that I didn't already know, after ~5 minutes of chatting:

> - It was Archimonde's idea for Arthas to become the Lich King
> - Arthas has only personally killed 5 orcs, 3 blademasters and 2 farseers
> - The Lich King's power comes from wielding Frostmourne and wearing the Helm of Domination:
>     - Frostmourne: A longsword that turns targets into undead Scourge (and imprisons their soul in the blade)
>     - Helm of Domination: A helmet that allows the wearer to control the undead Scourge
>    - Both items were crafted by the Runecarver against his will (forced by Zovaal, The Jailer)
> - Arthas now wishes to vanquish the spirit of the Lich King once and for all, but can't because he doesn't exist in any realm

What I learned from Queen of Hearts that I didn't already know, after ~5 minutes of chatting:

> - She doesn't really chop people's heads off - it's all for show to scare the lesser cards into falling in line, while the King of Hearts usually pardons them in secret
> - Queen of Hearts is loosely based on Queen Victoria
> - The Queen's identity outside of Wonderland is Cora Mills - the mother of both the Wicked Witch of the West (from _The Wizard of Oz_) and Evil Queen (from _Snow White_)
