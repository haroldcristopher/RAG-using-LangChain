## Ragdoll Studio Examples

- [**AI characters**](https://github.com/bennyschmidt/ragdoll-studio/tree/master/ragdoll-react) (default) - Create personas based on historical or fictional characters and chat with them. You can even base a persona on a subject matter to get life coaching, dating advice, coding assistance, and more. These personas, or "ragdolls", can reply in text format with an optional corresponding image. It could be a digital friend, therapist, personal storyteller, or an interactive learning tool.

- [**Instant assistants (by URL)**](https://github.com/bennyschmidt/ragdoll-studio/tree/master/examples/instant-assistant): Instantly create a shopping assistant for an e-commerce website or online catalog to help you find the right products, confirm details like shipping costs, inventory, and discounts to help clarify purchasing decisions. You can even base the knowledge on a search result or saved filter. Or create an instant research assistant to help you understand subject matter on a page.

- [**Comment/chat bots**](https://github.com/bennyschmidt/ragdoll-studio/tree/master/examples/comment-bots/forum): Create bots that respond to events in your app or website, or as the mind of a Slack or Discord bot that responds to user commands and provides information.

- [**Game NPCs**](https://github.com/bennyschmidt/ragdoll-studio/tree/master/examples/game-npcs/oracles-tomb): Create NPCs capable of dynamic conversations scoped to their knowledge with unique mechanics like:
    - *Gatekeeping*: The player has to ask the right questions to learn a specific knowledge detail in order to advance in the game
    - *Progression*: The player has to have already asked about topics A, B, and C before knowledge D will be given
    - *Clue-following*: The player has to talk to several different personas to get the complete set of knowledge details in order to advance
    - *Dynamic vendors*: The player and vendor get more flexibility in how they negotiate, and the conversation is unique whether or not the vendor is flexible on price
    - *General lore & dialogue*: The player gets to have realistic and unique conversations with the characters of the story

- [**Concept artists**](https://ragdoll-studio.vercel.app/feed): Generate concept art in a specific style.
