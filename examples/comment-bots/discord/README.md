It's as straightforward as any other Discord bot, start by setting up the basics:

Decide what events you want `ArthasGPT` to get invoked for, and give Discord permissions so it can respond in the right place:

That way you can tie the Discord bot activity into your existing app and handle them internally like you would any other request:
