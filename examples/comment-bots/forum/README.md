# Forum comment bot

A comment bot based on [ArthasGPT](https://github.com/bennyschmidt/ArthasGPT).

## Background

This example works more like a Slack or Discord bot, where Arthas listens for commands and responds accordingly. Instead of using slash commands, in this example Arthas just watches for any forum post that mentions his name. Whenever he's mentioned in a topic Arthas parses the question and posts the text response as a comment in the thread.
