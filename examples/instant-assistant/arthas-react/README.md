# Instant Assistant

React front-end for interacting with [ArthasGPT](https://github.com/bennyschmidt/ArthasGPT).

## Background

Arthas can store and index knowledge so fast you can deploy a persona to any live URL - even a temporary and encrypted one. I plugged in an Amazon search result page for "beauty products" and made an AI shopping assistant in seconds:

>
> Question: What's a good shampoo for under $20?
>
> Answer: Hi there! I recommend the Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo. It's fab and only $16.40 on sale! Great choice for under $20. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

#### Instant salesperson or research assistant

This inspired the idea to create an alternate front-end focused around the use case of an instant assistant. Because some web pages (especially in e-commerce like Amazon or academic sources like PubMed) can be so busy and hard to understand, the instant assistant comes in handy as its able to easily sift through the noise and find what you're looking for.

## Case studies

Note: You can edit the name and avatar, or choose another at random by closing and re-opening the chat. The random profiles are generated by [random-profile-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-profile-generator).

Note: Because I know the year/make/model of my car, I based Seymour off that selection on the auto parts website that sourced his knowledge, so that when I ask about parts we both know it's for my car. And because their website approximates my location Seymour already knows which store location I'm asking about, and for parts only available in-store he'll even recommend when I should swing by in person.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
