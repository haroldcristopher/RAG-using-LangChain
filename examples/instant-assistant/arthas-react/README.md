# Instant Salesperson

React front-end for interacting with [ArthasGPT](https://github.com/bennyschmidt/ArthasGPT).

## Background

Arthas can store and index knowledge so fast you can deploy a persona to any live URL - even a temporary and encrypted one. I plugged in an Amazon search result page for "beauty products" and made this AI sales agent in seconds:

> Question: What's a good shampoo for under $20?
>
> Answer: Hi there! I recommend the Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo. It's fab and only $16.40 on sale! Great choice for under $20. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

#### Images

The DALL-E 2 images here are pretty irrelevant, and generating one takes up the bulk of the model cost (and time it takes to respond), so ideally we'll modify it to pull an image directly from the page, or even provide only text without an image. We will probably also want to provide the URL to buy the product.

Here's a slightly different salesperson and question:

>
> Question: What's the most affordable red nail polish you have?
>
> Answer: Hi there! I'm Alli, your friendly nail polish expert! Looking for an affordable red shade? Look no further than the OPI Nail Lacquer! It's currently on sale for just $10.19. Grab it now and rock those stunning red nails! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’…

You can ask a Walmart shopping assistant for a list of gift ideas:

>
> Question: What are some good easter gifts for kids, and can you tell me how much they cost?
>
> Answer: I've found some great Easter gifts for kids at Walmart! Check out the Dudley's Easter Egg Party Pack for $13.98, Reese's Milk Chocolate Snack Size Peanut Butter Eggs Easter Candy for $3.96, Bluey Talking Bluey Plush for $19.97, Fun Express 12 pieces Large Solid Color Easter Bamboo Baskets for $34.40, Kit Kat, Reese's and Whoppers Assorted Flavored Easter Candy for $19.44, Time and Tru Women's Tiered Midi Dress with Puff Sleeves for $19.98, Medium Round White Paper Rope Easter Basket with Bunny Ears for $13.37, and Bluey Dance and Play 14 inch Animated Plush with Phrases Songs for $34.97. Happy Easter!

#### Instant salesperson

This case study inspired the idea to create an alternate front-end focused around the use case of an instant salesperson/shopping assistant. Because some web pages (especially in e-commerce) can be so busy and hard to navigate, the instant salesperson comes in handy as its able to easily sift through the noise and find what you're looking for.

#### Let's make a more relevant UI

## Case studies

Note: You can edit the name and avatar, or choose another at random by closing and re-opening the chat. The random profiles are generated by [random-profile-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-profile-generator).

#### Zenia, the beauty products guru:

Note: Because I know the year/make/model of my car, I based Seymour off that selection on the auto parts website that sourced his knowledge, so that when I ask about parts we both know it's for my car. And because their website approximates my location Seymour already knows which store location I'm asking about, and for parts only available in-store he'll even recommend when I should swing by in person.

#### Seymour, the car expert:

We can get into more in-depth conversations about price and part comparisons:

This site widget or browser extension would allow your users to create an instant AI shopping assistant based on any URL that has products listed, giving the shopper an alternative way to browse and buy.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
