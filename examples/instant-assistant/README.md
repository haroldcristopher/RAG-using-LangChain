# Instant Assistant

A live chat assistant based on [ArthasGPT](https://github.com/bennyschmidt/ArthasGPT).

## Background

Arthas can store and index knowledge so fast you can deploy a persona to any live URL - even a temporary and encrypted one. I plugged in an Amazon search result page for "beauty products" and made an AI shopping assistant in seconds:

>
> Question: What's a good shampoo for under $20?
>
> Answer: Hi there! I recommend the Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo. It's fab and only $16.40 on sale! Great choice for under $20. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

#### Instant salesperson or research assistant

This inspired the idea to create an alternate front-end focused around the use case of an instant assistant. Because some web pages (especially in e-commerce like Amazon or academic sources like PubMed) can be so busy and hard to understand, the instant assistant comes in handy as its able to easily sift through the noise and find what you're looking for.

#### Re-designed the chat UI

Note: Because I know the year/make/model of my car, I based Seymour off that selection on the auto parts website that sourced his knowledge, so that when I ask about parts we both know it's for my car. And because their website approximates my location Seymour already knows which store location I'm asking about, and for parts only available in-store he'll even recommend when I should swing by in person.
